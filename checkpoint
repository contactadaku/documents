followed the instructions in this link to generate the certs

All generated certs can be found in HF1
/opt/splunk/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_checkpoint_log_exporter/local

ca.pem and cp_client.crt was sent to the customer to upload

server.pem was generated by merging server.crt, server.key and ca.pem by running
>>>>> cat server.crt server.key ca.pem > server.pem

the server.pem should then be referencedin the inputs.conf
The ssl password is what you input you create server.csr
